# CognitoVault 🗝️

CognitoVault is an open-source browser extension designed to securely manage and transfer `localStorage` and cookies across different instances of a website. With CognitoVault, website owners can grant access to specific users without directly sharing their credentials.

## 🌟 Features

- **Secure Sharing**: Share access to your website by creating a vault containing `localStorage` and cookies.
- **Extension-based**: Currently available as a Chrome extension.
- **Import & Export**: Transfer vaults between different instances of a website.
- **Background Script**: Runs seamlessly in the background to manage and sync data.
- **Invite-Only Access**: Only users invited by the vault creator can import and access the stored data.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Create a Vault**: Website owners can create a vault containing the necessary `localStorage` and cookies.
2. **Invite Users**: Send invitations to specific users to access your vault.
3. **Import Vaults**: Users with the CognitoVault extension can import the vault data into their instance of the website.
4. **Background Sync**: The extension's content script runs in the background, ensuring data is synchronized and updated.
