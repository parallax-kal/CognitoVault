## CognitoVault 🗝️

CognitoVault is an open-source browser extension designed to securely manage and transfer `localStorage` and cookies across different instances of a website. With CognitoVault, website owners can grant access to specific users without directly sharing their credentials.

2. **Invite Users**: Send invitations to specific users to access your vault.
